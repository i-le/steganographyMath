    A:

    var x = null;
    function my Function() {

    
    Which of the following do you need to add, so that this code will work in CodePen or on another web page?
    
    var file = document.getElementById("finput");
    var image = new SimpleImage(file);
    var canvas = document.getElementById("can");
    image.drawTo(canvas);

    Question 6
    You have two pixels to convert to grayscale, and you would like to determine visually whether your code is likely to be working, so you work an example by hand.
    
    The first pixel is teal and has rgb(0,153,153), and the second pixel is purple and has rgb(153,51,255). Once the grayscale pixels are printed, which one should appear as a lighter gray (closer to white).
    
    
    
    A: First pixel
    
    
    
    
    Question 7
    You are building a web page, and you create a text input element and specify an element ID for it. Why did you do this?
